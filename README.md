# delta-MAPS
δ-MAPS is a method that identifies the semi-autonomous components of a spatio-temporal system and studies their weighted and potentially lagged interactions. The semi-autonomous components of the system are modeled as spatially contiguous, possibly overlapping, functionally homogeneous domains. To the best of our knowledge, δ-MAPS is the first method that can identify spatially contiguous and possibly overlapping clusters (i.e., domains). At a second step, δ-MAPS infers a directed and weighted network between the identified domains. Edge direction captures the temporal ordering of events while the weight associated to each edge captures the magnitude of interaction between domains.
